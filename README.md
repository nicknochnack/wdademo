# Develop a fully featured web app built on the Watson Discovery Service

In this Code Pattern, we walk you through a working example of a web application that queries and manipulates data from the Watson Discovery Service. This web app contains multiple UI components that you can use as a starting point for developing your own Watson Discovery Service applications. 

The main benefit of using the Watson Discovery Service is its powerful analytics engine that provides cognitive enrichments and insights into your data. This app provides examples of how to showcase these enrichments through the use of filters, lists and graphs. The key enrichments that we will focus on are:

* Entities - people, companies, organizations, cities, and more.
* Categories - classification of the data into a hierarchy of categories up to 5 levels deep.
* Concepts - identified general concepts that aren't necessarily referenced in the data.
* Keywords - important topics typically used to index or search the data.
* Sentiment - the overall positive or negative sentiment of each document.

For this Code Pattern, we will be using data that contains reviews of Airbnb properties located in the Austin, TX area. 

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:
* Load and enrich data in the Watson Discovery Service.
* Query and manipulate data in the Watson Discovery Service.
* Create UI components to represent enriched data created by the Watson Discovery Service.
* Build a complete web app that utilizes popular JavaScript technologies to feature Watson Discovery Service data and enrichments.

## Flow
1. The Airbnb review json files are added to the Discovery collection.
2. The user interacts with the backend server via the app UI. The frontend app UI uses React to render search results and can reuse all of the views that are used by the backend for server side rendering. The frontend is using semantic-ui-react components and is responsive.
3. User input is processed and routed to the backend server, which is responsible for server side rendering of the views to be displayed on the browser. The backend server is written using express and uses express-react-views engine to render views written using React.
4. The backend server sends user requests to the Watson Discovery Service. It acts as a proxy server, forwarding queries from the frontend to the Watson Discovery Service API while keeping sensitive API keys concealed from the user.

## UI controls and associated actions

Here is a rough sketch of the main UI screen, followed by a description of each UI component and their assoicated actions:

![](doc/source/images/ui-panel.png)

1. Search field and search parameters: Return results based on search criteria. Search parameters will effect how the user will enter values, how they will be displayed, and limit the number of matches.
2. List Filters: Multiple drop-down lists of filters that are applied to the search resullts. Each drop down list contains entities, categories, concepts and keywords associated with the results. For each drop down filter item, the number of matches will also be displayed. If a user selects a filter item, a new search will be conducted and will update the results panel (#3). Filter items selected will also effect what is shown in the tag cloud (#4).
3. Search results and pagination menu: Shows a page of result items (e.g. 5 per page) and a pagination menu to allow the user to scroll through pages of result items. There will also be a drop-down menu that will allow the user to sort the entries based on date, score, and sentiment value.
4. Tag cloud filter: Similar to the list filters (#2) but in a different format. One set of filter items (either entities, categories, concepts or keywords) can be displayed at one time. User can select/deselect items in the cloud to turn on/off filters. Applied filters in both filter views (#2 and #4) will always be in sync.
5. Trend chart: Chart to show the sentiment trend for a specific entity, category, concept, or keyword over time. The data will reflect the current matching result set.
6. Sentiment chart; Donut chart that shows the total percentages of postive, neutral and negative reviews of selected entities, categories, concepts, or keywords. The data will reflect the current matching result set.

# Steps

Use the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button **OR** create the services and run locally.

## Deploy to IBM Cloud

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-discovery-ui.git)
 
1. Press the above ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button and then click on ``Deploy``.

2. In Toolchains, click on Delivery Pipeline to watch while the app is deployed. Once deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking 'View app'.

![](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

3. To see the app and services created and configured for this journey, use the IBM Cloud dashboard. The app is named `watson-discovery-ui` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wdui-` prefix:
    * wdui-discovery-service

## Run locally
> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button.

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create IBM Cloud services](#2-create-ibm-cloud-services)
3. [Load the Discovery files](#3-load-the-discovery-files)
4. [Configure credentials](#4-configure-credentials)
5. [Run the application](#5-run-the-application)

### 1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-discovery-ui
```

### 2. Create IBM Cloud services

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Discovery**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery)

### 3. Load the Discovery files

Launch the **Watson Discovery** tool. Create a **new data collection**
and give the data collection a unique name.

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="doc/source/images/create-collection.png">
</p>

From the new collection data panel, under `Configuration` click the `Switch` button to create a new configuration file that will include extracting keywords as a function of data enrichment. Give the configuration file a unique name.

![Create config file](doc/source/images/create-keyword-config.gif)

> Note: failure to do this will result in no `keywords` being shown in the app. 

From the new collection data panel, under `Add data to this collection` use `Drag and drop your documents here or browse from computer` to seed the content with the json files extracted from `data/airbnb/`.

![Upload data to collection](doc/source/images/add-docs-to-collection.gif)

> Save the **environment_id** and **collection_id** for your `.env` file in the next step.

### 4. Configure credentials
```
cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```
# Copy this file to .env and replace the credentials with
# your own before starting the app.

# Watson Discovery
DISCOVERY_URL=<add_discovery_url>
DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID=<add_discovery_environment_id>
DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID=<add_discovery_collection_id>
## Un-comment and use either username+password or IAM apikey.
# DISCOVERY_IAM_APIKEY=<add_discovery_iam_apikey>
# DISCOVERY_USERNAME=<add_discovery_username>
# DISCOVERY_PASSWORD=<add_discovery_password>

# Run locally on a non-default port (default is 3000)
# PORT=3000
```

### 5. Run the application
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime or NPM.
1. Start the app by running `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.
1. Access the UI by pointing your browser at `localhost:3000`.
> Note: server host can be changed as required in app.js and `PORT` can be set in `.env`.

# Troubleshooting

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Discovery
environment is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass. The environment should
be usable on restart. If you used `Deploy to IBM Cloud` the restart should be automatic.

* Error: Only one free environment is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Discovery environment is created. If you already have a Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Discovery, check for an old service thay you may want to delete. Otherwise use the .env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID to tell the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment using the default configuration.

* Error when loading files into Discovery

  > Loading all 2000 document files at one time into Discovery can sometimes lead to "busy" errors. If this occurs, start over and load a small number of files at a time.

* No keywords appear in the app

  > This can be due to not having a proper configuration file assigned to your data collection. See [Step 3](#3-load-the-discovery-files) above.
